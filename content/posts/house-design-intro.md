Over the next 7-10 years I would like to design the ultimate dream house. I don't know what this means. What is an ultimate house? We'll wax poetically about it, and as I explore different concepts, such as how to design an optimal laundry room, and where to locate it, I'll be documenting those thoughts here. I want to eventually define my design goals, but for now we'll keep it pretty loosey-goosey and explore different things as the mood strikes.

One thought I had, was that at my current career progression and increasing costs, I am unlikely to be able to build a dream house before the kids start moving out or are teenagers. The ultimate house now is definitely going to be different as they age up and move out. The location to build it even changes thoughout my life, so that adds a fun design challenge. It makes more sense to optimize for, what would a house my grand kids would enjoy visiting, or my adult children could visit, be?

To kick things off, I wanted to start with Garage design. I expcet this to change a lot over the years, so I'm not going to worry about anything final. Here is a rough sketch of the garage I have now, so we can discuss some weaknesses:
